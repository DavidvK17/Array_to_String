# Array to string

This simple function receives and array of temperatures and returns a string display nicely when what temperature can be expected.

First I solved this by using a for of loop and by deconstructing the Array:
for(const [i, val] of arr.entries())
But using the forEach method seems more elegant and efficient to me.
